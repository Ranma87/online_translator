# online_translator
Online translator available in 13 languages. It is based on reverso.net from where it takes the information for the translations.

This project is part of many others in Hyperskill's website to learn to code in python.
The translator gets the parameters either from the command line or asks the user: source language, language to translate to and the word.
It retrieves the information in reverso.net and shows the first 5 possible translations and 5 examples.
The user can choose to translate a word from one language to all suported languages. In this case, the translator shows just one translation an one example in each language and saves the content in a local .txt file with the name of the word in the source language.
